        Hey there,my name is Lois Osei Ampofo and I am currently in level 200 and a student of University of Ghana, Legon.
     I have been in legon for a year now. 
    I joined this institution at the beginning of the 2020/2021 academic year, and it has not been bad so far.
    The school is great,the people are interesting and the atmosphere is quite condusive for studying. 
    I am reading BSc.Information Technology because I intend being a data analyst.
    I am very punctual and like to do all my work on time. I enjoy reading novels and cooking.    
     I would describe myself as a kind,generous and helpful person. 
     I love to help my friends out by giving them advice with their problems.
     I am an introvert,so I really find it difficult stepping out to meet new people and making new friends because I enjoy being in my own space.
    Although introverted, I like to talk, joke, laugh and humour people around me and I also get as much as I give.
     Well,there really isn't much to say about one's own self,so I guess this would be all for now.
     But hey,feel free to leave your details at the visitor's session so we can get interractive.
